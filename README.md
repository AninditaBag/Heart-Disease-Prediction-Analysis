# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Analysis
Objective of the project: 
Heart disease is considered as one of the major causes of death throughout the world. It cannot be easily predicted by the medical practitioners as it is a difficult task which demands expertise and higher knowledge for prediction. An automated system in medical diagnosis would enhance medical efficiency and also reduce costs. We will design a system that can efficiently discover the rules to predict the risk level of patients based on the given parameters about their health.
The goal is to extract hidden patterns by applying data mining techniques, which are noteworthy to heart diseases and to predict the presence of heart disease in patients where the presence is valued on a scale. The prediction of heart disease requires a huge size of data which is too complex and massive to process and analyze by conventional techniques. Our objective is to find out the suitable machine learning technique that is computationally efficient as well as accurate for the prediction of heart disease.
Here we will be dealing with the heart disease dataset and will analyze, predict the result whether the patient has heart disease or normal, i.e., heart disease prediction using R Programming.
In this analysis, I will use heart disease dataset to explore the highest important features that leads to heart disease. I would also do a logistic regression model to predict if a patient will have a heart disease or no.
