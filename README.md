# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Analysis
Heart disease is considered as one of the major causes of death throughout the world. An automated system in medical diagnosis would enhance medical efficiency and also reduce costs. We will design a system that can efficiently discover the rules to predict the risk level of patients based on the given parameters about their health. The goal is to extract hidden patterns by applying data mining techniques, which are noteworthy to heart diseases. In this analysis, I will also use heart disease dataset to explore the highest important features that leads to heart disease. 
Data At Hand:
Iâ€™ll be working with the Cleveland Clinic Heart Disease dataset which contains 13 variables related to 303 patient diagnostics and one outcome variable indicating the presence or absence of heart disease.
This dataset is all about heart disease. It contains:
1)age,  2)sex,  3)chest pain type (4 values) , 4)resting blood pressure , 5)serum cholesterol in mg/dl ,  6)Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl , 7)resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2) ,  8)maximum heart rate achieved ,  9)exercise-induced angina , 10)oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest ,  11)the slope of the peak exercise ST segment  ,12)number of major vessels (0-3) coloured by fluoroscopy  ,13)thal (thalassemia): 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversible defect  ,14)Diagnosis of Heart Disease :Indicates whether subject is suffering from heart disease or not.
